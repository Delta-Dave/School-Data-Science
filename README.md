# School-Data-Science
Learning to do data science, data visualization, and machine learning in Python with Jupyter Notebooks and a large data set about schools

## Directions for Use
This project uses data from the Civil Rights Data Collection. If you want to run the notebook, you will need to download and unzip 
the files found at https://ocrdata.ed.gov/DownloadDataFile and place them in a folder titled `Data Files`. You will also need to create 
a file named `CRDC (gifted only).csv` and place this in the `Data Files/Data Files and Layouts` folder.

## Where it is Right Now
Currently, this project is far from complete. I am using this as a learning experience and slowly building up. Due to this, I am in the 
middle of my work on the project. As of now, I have only begun cleaning the data and done some rudimentary visualization. Going further, 
I plan to do more visualization and eventually implement a machine learning algorithm to predict the size of gifted and talented programs.
