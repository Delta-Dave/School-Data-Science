This project uses data from the Civil Rights Data Collection. If you want to run the notebook, you will need to download and unzip the files found at https://ocrdata.ed.gov/DownloadDataFile and place them in a folder titled [Data Files]. You will also need to create a file named [CRDC (gifted only).csv] and place this in the Data Files/Data Files and Layouts folder.
